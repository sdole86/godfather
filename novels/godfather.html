                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Mario Puzo’s classic saga of an American crime family that became a global phenomenon—nominated
                        as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With its brilliant and brutal portrayal of the Corleone family, The Godfather burned its way
                        into our national consciousness. This unforgettable saga of crime and corruption, passion and
                        loyalty continues to stand the test of time, as the definitive novel of the Mafia underworld.

                        A #1 New York Times bestseller in 1969, Mario Puzo’s epic was turned into the incomparable film
                        of the same name, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, which won the Academy Award for Best
                        Picture. It is the original classic that has been often imitated, but never matched. A tale of
                        family and society, law and order, obedience and rebellion, it reveals the dark passions of
                        human nature played out against a backdrop of the American dream.

                    <h1>Summary</h1>
                    <p>The plot deals with a mob war fought between the Corleone family and the other four of the Five
                        Families of New York. After Don Vito Corleone is shot by men working for drug dealer Virgil "The
                        Turk" Sollozzo, his two sons, Santino and Michael must run the family business with the help of
                        consigliere Tom Hagen and the two capos Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. When Sollozzo and
                        an Irish police captain are murdered by Michael, the conflict escalates into a full scale war
                        which results in Santino's death and Michael, despite his wishes, ascending to the head of the
                        family. He slowly becomes more ruthless than his father, even killing his brother-in-law Carlo
                        Rizzi, who played a part in Santino's murder.</p>
                    <P> Many of the minor characters, such as the Don's godson Johnny Fontane and his friend Nino
                        Valenti, Sonny's former girlfriend Lucy Mancini, and Michael's bodyguard Al Neri, are expanded
                        on and given their own subplots. Many of these subplots are not included in the movie. The novel
                        culminates when Michael has his two main enemies, the novel's main antagonist, Emilio Barzini
                        and a lesser but still severely important antagonist, Philip Tattaglia, assassinated. After the
                        total elimination of the Tattaglia family and Barzini family, Michael sells all his business in
                        New York with the intention of making the Corleone family a legitimate business in Las Vegas.
