                    <p>THE MISSING YEARS FROM THE GREATEST CRIME SAGA OF ALL TIME</p>

                    <p>Thirty-five years ago, Mario Puzo’s great American tale, The Godfather, was published, and
                        popular culture was indelibly changed. Now, in The Godfather Returns, acclaimed novelist Mark
                        Winegardner continues the story–the years not covered in Puzo’s bestselling book or in Francis
                        Ford Coppola’s classic films.
                    </p>
                    <P>It is 1955. Michael Corleone has won a bloody victory in the war among New York’s crime families.
                        Now he wants to consolidate his power, save his marriage, and take his family into legitimate
                        businesses. To do so, he must confront his most dangerous adversary yet, Nick Geraci, a former
                        boxer who worked his way through law school as a Corleone street enforcer, and who is every bit
                        as deadly and cunning as Michael. Their personal cold war will run from 1955 to 1962, exerting
                        immense influence on the lives of America’s most powerful criminals and their loved ones,
                        including

                    <h1>Summary</h1>
                    <p>Michael has a family of his own, with wife Kay, and his two children. Like his father before him,
                        Michael is determined to provide for and protect his family. His dream is to establish himself
                        as a legitimate businessman, so that his family can come out of the shadows into the light.
                        Michael's long-term scheme to accomplish this involves a lot of bold, risky moves, some legal,
                        some not. While Michael begins investing in legitimate schemes like legalized gambling and real
                        estate, he's simultaneously putting a man who will do his bidding in the White House, and
                        conspiring to assassinate the president of Cuba to legalize casinos there. Michael's father was
                        America's capo di tutti capi, Boss of all Bosses within the Mafia. But even his father never
                        gambled for such high stakes. No one has before.
                    </P>
                    <P>Caught up in his machinations is his brother, Fredo Corleone, who is the family black sheep, and
                        ultimately the weak link that Nick Geraci will use to attack Michael. Geraci is an up and comer
                        in Michael's organization who Michael, unwisely, steps on in his bid for power. Geraci, a man
                        very similar to Michael, becomes the Don's most formidable rival. But Michael doesn't intend to
                        let his enemies stop him from achieving enough power to control both the Mafia and the
                        government. With the help of talented men like Pete Clemenza and Tom Hagen, most of Michael's
                        plans succeed. But he's willing to sacrifice everything, including his family, to achieve his
                        dreams. By the end of the book, Michael has come full circle. His attempts to go legitimate have
                        only involved him more heavily in organized crime. The reader leaves the story with the
                        realization that Michael enjoys the planning and the scheming more than he wants to reach his
                        goal of going legitimate. One wonders if Michael will continue to fight his destiny, or if he
                        and his last surviving brother, Tom Hagen, will embrace their roles in the Corleone legacy.
