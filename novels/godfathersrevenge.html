                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>It is 1963 in New York, and things have never been better for the Corleones. One problem remains
                        however - Michael has sworn revenge upon the traitorous former Corleone capo, Nick Geraci. Up
                        until now Geraci has evaded him. And to add to this Jimmy Shea, president of the United States
                        and close friend of the Corleone's, is assasinated.
                    </P>

                    <h1>Summary</h1>
                    <p>The story begins with Michael Corleone having a dream in which his brother Fredo Corleone, whom
                        he had killed, warns him of a coming threat. At the same time, the apparition tries to give
                        Michael a message, which he does not comprehend. Michael's guilt over ordering Fredo's murder
                        has aged him beyond his years—his hair has turned white, his diabetes has worsened, and he has
                        chronic insomnia. He is also depressed over his failing relationship with his ex-wife, Kay
                        Adams, and his son, Anthony, who both know the truth about Fredo's death.</p>

                    <P>Carlo Tramonti, a boss of the New Orleans crime syndicate, is introduced as he is deported by the
                        INS to his native Colombia. Meanwhile, Attorney General Daniel Shea (analogous to Robert F.
                        Kennedy) declares war on the Mafia.

                        Tom Hagen meets with a CIA agent named Joe Lucadello in a Protestant church in Florida. He
                        informs Hagen that Nick Geraci, a former caporegime for the Corleones, has turned up. </P>

                    
                    <p>
                        Stracci asks Geraci to meet Don Greco, the Greek, who due to Stracci's influence was to vote
                        against Michael. Geraci meets him at a restaurant on Staten Island. When he arrives, however, he
                        realizes he has walked him into a trap; Michael arrives and orders Barone to shoot Geraci to
                        prove his loyalty. Geraci grabs the gun, shoots two bodyguards and injures Al Neri, but is
                        mortally wounded in the process. Eddie Paradise delivers the coup de grace, shooting him
                        execution-style.</P>

                    <P>Michael in turns has the following people executed:

                        Carlo Tramonti is shot in the back of his head and his body tossed onto the highway.
                        Tramonti's brother, who sought to re-open his brother's murder case, dies of "natural causes".
                        Joe Lucadello has an ice pick rammed into his eye.
                        In the novel's final scene, Michael's sister, Connie, tells him that Fredo had an illegitimate
                        child with Rita Duvall, whom Michael had briefly dated before realizing he was still in love
                        with Kay.
