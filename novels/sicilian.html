                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>After Mario Puzo wrote his internationally acclaimed The Godfather, he has often been imitated
                        but never equaled. Puzo's classic novel, The Sicilian, stands as a cornerstone of his work—a
                        lushly romantic, unforgettable tale of bloodshed, justice, and treachery. . . .

                    </p>
                    <P>The year is 1950. Michael Corleone is nearing the end of his exile in Sicily. The Godfather has
                        commanded Michael to bring a young Sicilian bandit named Salvatore Guiliano back with him to
                        America. But Guiliano is a man entwined in a bloody web of violence and vendettas. In Sicily,
                        Guiliano is a modern day Robin Hood who has defied corruption—and defied the Cosa Nostra. Now,
                        in the land of mist-shrouded mountains and ancient ruins, Michael Corleone's fate is entwined
                        with the dangerous legend of Salvatore Guiliano: warrior, lover, and the ultimate Siciliano.</P>

                    <h1>Summary</h1>
                    <p>Turi Guiliano is a legendary bandit in
                        Sicily. He became a bandit by accident having killed a police officer who shot him, he fled to
                        the mountains and became a bandit to survive. He had rules and principles that had to be
                        followed. Half of the band's profits had to be given to the poor and this is why he and his band
                        were legendary and supported by the people.

                    </p>
                    <P>Turi had his cousin, Aspanu, as his second in command in the hills that they had played in as
                        children. Turi began with a fear of the Mafia and would not have anything to do with them. He
                        was spotted by the powerful Maria man Don Croce as a possible successor and in the early days
                        Don Croce helped Turi out. However, Turi came to hate the Mafia and was determined to destroy
                        them in his desire to help the poor people of Sicily. Turi saw himself as serving the poor while
                        he viewed the Mafia as serving the rich.

                    </p>
                    <P>Little by little, Turi encroaches on their territory. He also becomes more ruthless and violent
                        during his seven years in the hills. The government mounts a major campaign against him but need
                        his help in suppressing the Communists and Socialists. He is promised by Don Croce that the
                        government will halt its campaign against him and give him a pardon in exchange for his help. He
                        agrees to help them and then is set up by Don Croce with the massacre at Portella della
                        Ginestra. By this time he and Don Croce are bitter enemies.

                    </p>
                    <P> When Michael Corleone is ready to leave Sicily and return to America after his two year exile,
                        his plans are changed when he receives orders from his father, Vito Corleone to meet with Don
                        Croce and help Turi Guiliano escape to America. At the luncheon with the Mafia don is a high
                        ranking police official who also says he is trying to help Turi escape. Michael is not sure what
                        is going on especially when he finds that Don Croce and Turi are bitter enemies but he tried to
                        follow the orders of his father. Michael receives Turi's Testament and sends it on to America,
                        thinking it will be published in the event of Turi's death. The Testament and the documents with
                        it will bring down the Christian Democrat government.</P>
