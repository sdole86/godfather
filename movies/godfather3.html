                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <P>In 1979, Michael Corleone is approaching 60. Wracked with guilt over his ruthless rise to power,
                        especially for having ordered his brother Fredo Corleone's murder, he donates millions to
                        charitable causes. Michael and Kay are divorced; their children, Anthony and Mary, live with
                        Kay. At the reception following a papal order induction ceremony in St. Patrick's Old Cathedral
                        in Michael's honor, Anthony tells his father that he is leaving law school to become an opera
                        singer. Kay supports his decision, but Michael wants Anthony to complete his law degree first;
                        nevertheless, Michael agrees to let Anthony go his own way. Michael and Kay have an uneasy
                        reunion when Kay reveals that she and Anthony know the truth about Fredo's death. Vincent
                        Mancini, the illegitimate son of Michael's long-dead brother Sonny Corleone, arrives at the
                        reception. Michael's sister, Connie Corleone, arranges for Vincent to settle a dispute with his
                        rival, Joey Zasa, but Zasa calls Vincent a bastard, and Vincent bites Zasa's ear. Michael,
                        troubled by Vincent's fiery temper yet impressed by his loyalty, agrees to include Vincent in
                        the family business.
                    </P>
                    <P>Michael knows that the head of the Vatican Bank, Archbishop Gilday, has accumulated a massive
                        deficit and offers $600M in exchange for shares in Internazionale Immobiliare,[3] an
                        international real estate company, which would make him its largest single shareholder. He makes
                        a tender offer to buy the Vatican's 25% share in the company, which will give him controlling
                        interest. Immobiliare's board approves the offer, pending ratification by the Pope.
                    </P>
                    <P>Don Altobello, a New York Mafia boss and Connie's godfather, tells Michael that his partners on
                        The Commission want in on the Immobiliare deal. Michael pays them from the sale of his Las Vegas
                        holdings. Zasa receives nothing and, declaring Michael his enemy, storms out. Don Altobello,
                        assuring Michael that he can diplomatically resolve the matter, leaves to speak to Zasa. Moments
                        later, a helicopter hovers outside the conference room and opens fire. Most of the bosses are
                        killed, but Michael, Vincent, and Michael's bodyguard, Al Neri, escape. Michael realizes that
                        Altobello is the traitor, and suffers a diabetic stroke. As Michael recuperates, Vincent and
                        Mary begin a romance, while Neri and Connie give Vincent permission to retaliate against Zasa.
                        During a street festival, Vincent kills Zasa. Michael berates Vincent for his actions and
                        insists that Vincent end his relationship with Mary because they are first cousins and because
                        Vincent is in organized crime.
                    </P>
                    <P>The family goes to Sicily for Anthony's operatic debut in Palermo at the Teatro Massimo. Michael
                        tells Vincent to pretend to defect from the Corleone family in order to spy on Altobello.
                        Altobello introduces Vincent to Licio Lucchesi, Immobiliare's chairman. Michael visits Cardinal
                        Lamberto, anticipated being the next pope, to discuss the deal. Lamberto persuades Michael to
                        make his first confession in 30 years, during which Michael tearfully confesses that he ordered
                        Fredo's murder. Lamberto says that Michael deserves to suffer for his sins, but can be redeemed.
                        He gives him sacramental absolution, permanently forgiving all his past sins in the eyes of God.
                        Michael discovers that the Immobiliare deal is an elaborate swindle, arranged by Lucchesi,
                        Gilday, and Vatican accountant Frederick Keinszig.

                    <P>Vincent tells Michael that Altobello has hired Mosca, a veteran hitman, to assassinate Michael.
                        Mosca and his son, disguised as priests, kill Corleone family friend Don Tommasino as he returns
                        to his villa. While Michael and Kay tour Sicily, Michael asks for Kay's forgiveness, and they
                        admit they still love each other. At Tommasino's funeral, Michael vows to sin no more. Following
                        the pope's death, Cardinal Lamberto is elected to succeed him, and humbly accepts, choosing as
                        his name Pope John Paul I. Subsequently, the Immobiliare deal is ratified. The plotters against
                        the ratification attempt to cover their tracks and Gilday kills the new pope with poisoned tea.
                        Michael sees that Vincent is a changed man and names him the new Don of the Corleone family, in
                        return for ending his romance with his cousin Mary.

                    </P>
                    <P>The family sees Anthony's performance in Cavalleria rusticana in Palermo while Vincent exacts his
                        revenge:</P>
                    <UI>
                        <LI>Vincent's men smother Keinszig and then hang him from a bridge, making his death look like a
                            suicide;
                        <LI>At the opera, Connie gives Altobello a poisoned cannoli and watches him die from her opera
                            box;</LI>
                        <LI>Calò, Tommasino's former bodyguard, stabs Lucchesi in the neck with his own spectacles.</LI>
                        <LI>Neri travels to the Vatican, where he shoots and kills Gilday.</LI>
                        <LI>At the opera house during Anthony's performance, three of Vincent's men search for Mosca,
                            but he overcomes them. After the show, on the opera house steps as they leave, Mosca shoots
                            at Michael, wounding him; a second bullet hits Mary, killing her. Vincent shoots and kills
                            Mosca. Michael cradles Mary's body and screams in agony; the scene fades out into a montage
                            of Michael dancing with Mary, his first wife, Apollonia, and finally, Kay.

                    <P>Years later, an elderly Michael, sitting alone in the courtyard of Don Tommasino's villa, slumps
                        over in his chair and falls lifeless to the ground.

                    <h2>Box Office</h2>
                    <P>The film opened in 1,901 theaters, and grossed $19.6 million in its opening weekend, finishing
                        second behind Home Alone.[21] It would go on to generate a total of $6 million on Christmas Day,
                        which was the highest at the time. For seven years, the film held that record until 1997 when it
                        was surpassed by Titanic.[22] In its second weekend it made $8.3 million, finishing third.</P>

                    <h2>Critical Response</h2>
                    <P>Ebert's colleague, Gene Siskel, also gave the film high praise, and placed it tenth in his list
                        of the ten best films of 1990. Siskel admitted that the ending was the film's weakest part,
                        citing Al Pacino's makeup as very poor. He also said, "[Another] problem is the casting of Sofia
                        Coppola, who is out of her acting league here. She's supposed to be Andy Garcia's love interest
                        but no sparks fly. He's more like her babysitter." In response to Ebert's defense of Coppola,
                        Siskel said: "I know what you're saying about her being sort of natural and not the polished
                        bombshell, and that would've been wrong. There is one, a photographer in the picture, who takes
                        care of that role, but at the same time, I don't think it's explained why [Vincent] really comes
                        onto her, unless this guy is the most venal, craven guy, but look who he's playing around with.
                        He's playing around with the Godfather's daughter."</P>
                    <h2>Accolades</h2>
                    <P>Although reception to the film was mixed, the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards
                        including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Andy García), Best
                        Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Dean Tavoularis, Gary
                        Fettis), Best Music, Song (for Carmine Coppola and John Bettis for "Promise Me You'll
                        Remember").[39][40] It is the only film in the series not to have Al Pacino nominated for an
                        Academy Award (he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for The Godfather and for Best Actor
                        for The Godfather Part II). It is the only film in the trilogy not to win for Best Picture or
                        any other Academy Award for that matter, as well as the only film in the trilogy not selected
                        for preservation by the U.S. National Film Registry as of 2022. Along with The Lord of the
                        Rings, The Godfather Trilogy shares the distinction that all of its installments were nominated
                        for Best Picture.</P>
