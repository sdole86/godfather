                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <P>In 1945 New York City, Corleone crime family don Vito Corleone listens to requests during his
                        daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a former Marine, introduces
                        his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and
                        Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role. Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom
                        Hagen, to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz complies after he finds
                        the severed head of his prized stallion in his bed.
                    </P>
                    <P>Near Christmas, drug baron Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his narcotics business and for
                        protection from the law. Vito declines, citing that involvement in narcotics would alienate his
                        political connections. Suspicious of Sollozzo's partnership with the Tattaglia crime family,
                        Vito sends his enforcer Luca Brasi to meet with the Tattaglias. Brasi is garroted to death
                        during the meeting. Later, enforcers gun down Vito and kidnap Hagen. With Corleone's first-born
                        Sonny now in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept the narcotics deal.
                        Sonny retaliates for Brasi's death with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Vito survives the shooting and
                        is visited in the hospital by Michael, who finds him unprotected after NYPD officers on
                        Sollozzo's payroll cleared out Vito's guards. Michael thwarts another attempt on his father's
                        life but is beaten by corrupt police captain Mark McCluskey. Sollozzo and McCluskey request to
                        meet with Michael and settle the dispute. Michael feigns interest and agrees to meet, but
                        hatches a plan with Sonny and Corleone capo Clemenza to kill them and go into hiding. Michael
                        meets Sollozzo and McCluskey at a Bronx restaurant; after retrieving a handgun planted into the
                        bathroom by Clemenza, he shoots both men dead.
                    </P>
                    <P>Despite a clampdown by the authorities for the killing of a police captain, the Five Families
                        erupt in open warfare. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo, Vito's second son, is sheltered
                        by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny publicly attacks and threatens Carlo for physically abusing
                        Connie. When he abuses her again, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed and murdered by
                        gangsters at a highway toll booth. In Sicily, Michael meets and marries a local woman,
                        Apollonia, but she is killed shortly thereafter by a car bomb intended for him.
                    </P>
                    <P>Devastated by Sonny's death and tired of war, Vito sets a meeting with the Five Families. He
                        assures them that he will withdraw his opposition to their narcotics business and forgo avenging
                        Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and
                        marry Kay. Kay gives birth to two children in the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end
                        of his life and Fredo not suited to lead, Michael assumes the position of head of the Corleone
                        family. Vito reveals to Michael that it was Don Barzini who ordered the hit on Sonny and warns
                        him that Barzini would try to kill him at a meeting organized by a traitorous Corleone capo.
                        With Vito's support, Michael relegates Hagen to managing operations in Las Vegas as he is not a
                        "wartime consigliere". Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's
                        casinos and is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.
                    </P>
                    <P>In 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack. At Vito's funeral, Tessio asks Michael to meet with
                        Barzini, signaling his betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's
                        baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the
                        dons of the Five Families and Greene, and Tessio is executed for his treachery. Michael extracts
                        Carlo's confession to playing a part in Sonny's murder, assuring Carlo he is only being exiled,
                        not murdered; afterward, Clemenza garrotes Carlo to death. Connie confronts Michael about
                        Carlo's death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if Connie is telling the truth and is
                        relieved when he denies it. As Kay leaves, capos enter the office and pay reverence to Michael
                        as "Don Corleone" before closing the door.

                    <h2>Box Office</h2>
                    <P>The Godfather was a
                        blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972.[163]
                        The film's opening day gross from five theaters was $57,829 with ticket prices increased from $3
                        to $3.50.[142] Prices in New York increased further at the weekend to $4, and the number of
                        showings increased from four times a day to seven times a day.[142] The film grossed $61,615 in
                        Toronto for the weekend[142] and $240,780 in New York,[164] for an opening weekend gross of
                        $302,395. The film grossed $454,000 for the week in New York[142] and $115,000 in Toronto[147]
                        for a first week gross of $568,800, which made it number one at the U.S. box office for the
                        week.[165] In its first five days of national release, it grossed $6.8 million, taking its gross
                        up to $7,397,164.[166] A week later its gross had reached $17,291,705[167] with the one week
                        gross of around $10 million being an industry record.[168] It grossed another $8.7 million by
                        April 9 to take its gross to $26,000,815.[169] After 18 weeks at number one in the United
                        States, the film had grossed $101 million, the fastest film to reach that milestone.[170][171]
                        Some news articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North
                        America,[148] but such accounts are erroneous; this record belongs to The Sound of Music,
                        released in 1965.[172] It remained at number one in the US for another five weeks to bring its
                        total to 23 consecutive weeks at number one before being unseated by Butterflies Are Free for
                        one week before becoming number one for another three weeks.[173][174]
                    </P>
                    <P>The film eventually earned $81.5 million in theatrical rentals in the US and Canada during its
                        initial release,[163][175] increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in
                        1973,[176] and including a limited re-release in 1997,[177] it ultimately earned an equivalent
                        exhibition gross of $135 million, with a production cost of $6.5 million.[146] It displaced Gone
                        with the Wind to claim the record as the top rentals earner,[163] a position it would retain
                        until the release of Jaws in 1975.[148][178] The film repeated its native success overseas,
                        earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the
                        highest net earner.[179] Profits were so high for The Godfather that earnings for Gulf & Western
                        Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount, jumped from 77 cents per share to $3.30 a share for the
                        year, according to a Los Angeles Times article, dated December 13, 1972.[148] Re-released eight
                        more times since 1997, it has grossed between $250 million and $291 million in worldwide box
                        office receipts,[N 2] and adjusted for ticket price inflation in North America, ranks among the
                        top 25 highest-grossing films

                    <h2>Critical Response</h2>
                    <P>
                        The Godfather has received overwhelming critical acclaim and is seen as one of the greatest and
                        most influential films of all time, particularly of the gangster genre.[181] On review
                        aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 97% approval rating based on 148 reviews, with an
                        average rating of 9.40/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "One of Hollywood's greatest
                        critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie
                        transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema."[182] Metacritic,
                        which uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a score of 100 out of 100 based on 16
                        critic reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[183]
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times praised Coppola's efforts to follow the storyline of the
                        novel, the choice to set the film in the same time as the novel, and the film's ability to
                        "absorb" the viewer over its three-hour run time.[184] Ebert named The Godfather "The best film
                        of 1972".[185] The Chicago Tribune's Gene Siskel gave the film four out of four, commenting that
                        it was "very good".[186]
                    </P>
                    <P>The Village Voice's Andrew Sarris believed Brando portrayed Vito Corleone well and that his
                        character dominated each scene it appeared in, but felt Puzo and Coppola had the character of
                        Michael Corleone too focused on revenge.[187] In addition, Sarris stated that Richard
                        Castellano, Robert Duvall, and James Caan were good in their respective roles.[187] Pauline Kael
                        of The New Yorker wrote "If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come
                        out of a merger of commerce and art, “The Godfather” is it."[188]
                    </P>
                    <P>Desson Howe of The Washington Post called the film a "jewel" and wrote that Coppola deserves most
                        of the credit for the film.[189] Writing for The New York Times, Vincent Canby felt that Coppola
                        had created one of the "most brutal and moving chronicles of American life" and went on to say
                        that it "transcends its immediate milieu and genre".[190][191] Director Stanley Kubrick thought
                        the film had the best cast ever and could be the best movie ever made.[192] Stanley Kauffmann of
                        The New Republic wrote negatively of the film in a contemporary review, claiming that Pacino
                        "rattles around in a part too demanding for him," while also criticizing Brando's make-up and
                        Rota's score.[193]
                    </P>
                    <P>Previous mafia films had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider.[194]
                        In contrast, The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to
                        corrupt society.[194] Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful,
                        no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering.[195]
                        George De Stefano argues that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic
                        gender stereotyping (such as when Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane to "act like a man") and is
                        an important part of the film's appeal.[196]
                    </P>
                    <P>Remarking on the fortieth anniversary of the film's release, film critic John Podhoretz praised
                        The
                        Godfather as "arguably the great American work of popular art" and "the summa of all great
                        moviemaking before it".[197] Two years before, Roger Ebert had written in his journal that it
                        "comes
                        closest to being a film everyone agrees... is unquestionably great"

                    <P>Rota's score was also nominated for Grammy Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture or
                        TV Special at the 15th Grammy Awards.[202][203] Rota was announced the winner of the category on
                        March 3 at the Grammys' ceremony in Nashville, Tennessee.[202][203]

                    <P>When the nominations for the 45th Academy Awards were revealed on February 12, 1973, The
                        Godfather was nominated for eleven awards.[204][205] The nominations were for: Best Picture,
                        Best Costume Design, Marlon Brando for Best Actor, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for Best
                        Adapted Screenplay, Pacino, Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, Best Film
                        Editing, Nino Rota for Best Original Score, Coppola for Best Director, and Best
                        Sound.[204][205][206] Upon further review of Rota's love theme from The Godfather, the Academy
                        found that Rota had used a similar score in Eduardo De Filippo's 1958 comedy
                        Fortunella.[207][208][209] This led to re-balloting, where members of the music branch chose
                        from six films: The Godfather and the five films that had been on the shortlist for best
                        original dramatic score but did not get nominated. John Addison's score for Sleuth won this new
                        vote, and thus replaced Rota's score on the official list of nominees.[210] Going into the
                        awards ceremony, The Godfather was seen as the favorite to take home the most awards.[200] From
                        the nominations that The Godfather had remaining, it only won three of the Academy Awards: Best
                        Actor for Brando, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture.[206][211]

                    <P>Brando, who had also not attended the Golden Globes ceremony two months earlier,[209][212]
                        boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony and refused to accept the Oscar,[32] becoming the second
                        actor to refuse a Best Actor award after George C. Scott in 1970.[213][214] Brando sent American
                        Indian Rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather in his place, to announce at the awards podium
                        Brando's reasons for declining the award, which were based on his objection to the depiction of
                        American Indians by Hollywood and television.[213][214][215] Pacino also boycotted the
                        ceremony;[32] he was insulted at being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting
                        Actor, when he had more screen time than his co-star and Best Actor-winner Brando, and thus
                        should have received the nomination for Best Actor.[216]

                    <P>The Godfather had five nominations for awards at the 26th British Academy Film Awards. The
                        nominees were: Pacino for Most Promising Newcomer, Rota for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film
                        Music, Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, and Brando for Best Actor, the film's costume designer
                        Anna Hill Johnstone for Best Costume Design. The only nomination to win was that of Rota
