                <P>In his novel The Godfather, Mario Puzo introduces Michael with the following physical description:
                    “He did not have the heavy, Cupid-shaped face of [his siblings], and his jet black hair was straight
                    rather than curly. His skin was a clear olive-brown that would have been called beautiful in a girl.
                    He was handsome in a delicate way.” Later in the novel, Puzo writes, “Michael was not tall or
                    heavily built but his presence seemed to radiate danger.”</P>

                <P>Unlike his two older brothers, Michael wants nothing to do with the Corleone "family business",
                    wanting instead to lead a more Americanized life. Vito does not want Michael to join the Corleone
                    criminal empire either, hoping that his favorite son would go into politics. Michael was enrolled at
                    Dartmouth College, but dropped out to enlist in the United States Marine Corps the day after the
                    attack on Pearl Harbor. During World War II, he fights in the Pacific War, and is wounded in battle.
                    For his bravery, he received a battlefield commission to the rank of Lieutenant, and was awarded the
                    Silver Star and the Navy Cross. He was discharged as a Captain after V-J Day in the fall of 1945.
                    His heroics during the war were featured in Life magazine.</P>

                <P>During the autumn of 1945, Michael is discharged from the Marines, unaware that Vito secretly
                    arranged for his discharge, using his political influence. Michael returns home to attend his sister
                    Connie's wedding, accompanied by Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), his college sweetheart. Michael stays for
                    a few weeks, intending to re-enter college without telling his family.</P>

                <P>Just before Christmas 1945, Vito is critically wounded in an assassination attempt by drug kingpin
                    Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), pushing a reluctant Michael into the Mafia world he has avoided for
                    so long. Arriving at the hospital, he finds his bedridden father unprotected from potential attack.
                    While awaiting Corleone reinforcements, Michael prevents a second assassination attempt on Vito by
                    Sollozzo, then affirms his loyalty to his father. Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), a
                    corrupt NYPD captain on Sollozzo's payroll, breaks Michael's jaw before more Corleone button men
                    arrive.</P>

                <P>As Vito Corleone recuperates, Sollozzo requests that Michael broker a truce, but acting boss Sonny,
                    suspecting a trap, refuses and demands the other Mafia families hand over Sollozzo to the Corleone
                    family or else face war. Michael volunteers to meet Sollozzo in a public place and kill him and
                    McCluskey. Hagen warns that killing McCluskey would violate a long-standing Mafia rule not to kill
                    police officers, and says it would incite deadly backlash from rival Mafia families and law
                    enforcement. Michael argues they can publicly expose McCluskey as a corrupt cop involved in the drug
                    trade and serving as Sollozzo's bodyguard, contending that McCluskey has crossed into their world
                    and is fair game. Sonny agrees and approves the hit.</P>

                <P>After careful preparation, Michael meets with Sollozzo and McCluskey at an Italian restaurant in The
                    Bronx. He retrieves a handgun that Corleone caporegime Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) had
                    planted beforehand in the bathroom and kills Sollozzo and McCluskey by shooting them at point-blank
                    range. This ignites the New York underworld's first Mafia war in a decade.</P>

                <P>Michael escapes to Sicily and spends two years under Corleone ally Don Tommasino's (Corrado Gaipa)
                    protection. Michael falls in love with and marries a young local woman named Apollonia Vitelli
                    (Simonetta Stefanelli). Back in the United States, Sonny is murdered. After Michael is notified of
                    Sonny's murder, he and Apollonia prepare to move to Siracusa, but she is killed by a car bomb meant
                    for Michael, proving the other Mafia families know where he is hiding.</P>

                <P>Michael returns to the United States in 1950[7] and assumes Sonny's role as Vito's heir apparent.
                    After Vito's suspicions are confirmed that Don Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte), his main rival in New
                    York City, is the mastermind of his shooting and Sonny's murder, he and Michael begin a secret,
                    complex plot to wipe out the other New York Dons. They deliberately allow their rivals to whittle
                    away at Corleone interests to lull them into inaction. Meanwhile, Michael convinces his father that
                    it is time to remove the family from crime. More than a year following his return, Michael reunites
                    with Kay and they marry. He promises her the Corleone family will be completely legitimate in five
                    years. Within three years, they have two children, Anthony and Mary.</P>

                <P>Vito semi-retires in 1954, and Michael becomes operating head of the family. He offers to buy out
                    casino owner Moe Greene's (Alex Rocco) stake in the Las Vegas casino that the Corleones bankrolled,
                    intending to move the family to Nevada as part of his effort to legitimize the Corleone interests;
                    Greene refuses to sell. Corleone family caporegimes Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda) and Clemenza
                    request permission to begin operating their own families in Corleone territory. Michael, with Vito's
                    support, advises them to be patient and wait until the move to Las Vegas is completed. Tessio and
                    Clemenza agree, but are clearly dissatisfied.</P>

                <P>In 1955, Vito warns Michael that Barzini will likely attempt to assassinate Michael under the
                    pretense of negotiating peace between the families, using a disloyal contact within the Corleone
                    regime. Whoever approaches Michael about the meeting, Vito explains, will be the traitor within the
                    family. Shortly thereafter, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with his grandson Anthony in
                    his tomato garden.</P>

                <P>At Vito's funeral, Tessio tells Michael that Barzini wants to arrange a meeting, confirming Vito's
                    prediction. Michael sets his plan in motion to murder the other New York Mafia heads: Barzini,
                    Philip Tattaglia (Victor Rendina), Carmine Cuneo (Rudy Bond), and Victor Stracci (Don Costello), as
                    well as Greene. The plot unfolds on the same day Michael stands as godfather to Connie's newborn
                    son. Later the same day, he has Tessio and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), Connie's abusive husband who
                    conspired in Sonny's murder, executed. In one stroke, Michael re-establishes the Corleone family as
                    the nation's most powerful crime family and establishes a reputation as being even more cunning and
                    ruthless than his father.</P>

                <P>A few days later, Connie furiously accuses Michael of murdering Carlo. When challenged by Kay,
                    Michael denies having ordered Carlo's murder. Kay, initially believing Michael, later observes him
                    receiving his capos. Clemenza addresses Michael as "Don Corleone" and kisses his hand in the same
                    manner that he did with Michael's father. Kay realizes Connie's accusations were true, and that
                    Michael has become a powerful Don becoming his father's successor in every way. In the novel, Kay
                    leaves Michael, but Hagen persuades her to return.</P>
