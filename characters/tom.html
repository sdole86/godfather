            <div id="tabs-4" class="letter">
                <P>In both the novel and film, Hagen is introduced as an important member of the Corleone family. As a
                    child he grew up in a broken family, the son of an abusive alcoholic. Sonny Corleone finds the
                    orphaned Hagen living on the street and suffering from an eye infection, takes him home, and demands
                    he live with the Corleone family. Vito Corleone becomes a surrogate father to Hagen, but never
                    officially adopts him out of respect for the boy's biological father.

                </P>
                <P> In the novel, Hagen asks to work for Vito after graduating from law school, knowing full well that
                    his adoptive father is the most powerful Mafia chief in the nation. Vito is happy to employ Hagen
                    into his empire, having often said that lawyers can steal more than a phalanx of gangsters. Hagen
                    marries an Italian woman, Theresa, with whom he has two sons, Frank and Andrew, and a daughter,
                    Gianna.

                </P>
                <P>After Vito's longtime consigliere Genco Abbandando is diagnosed with cancer, Hagen becomes acting
                    consigliere and succeeds to the post formally after Abbandando's death. Vito is initially reluctant
                    to give Hagen the post full-time, considering Hagen is not a Sicilian.

                </P>
                <P>When famous singer/actor Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) seeks his godfather Vito's help in securing a
                    movie role that could revitalize his fading career, Vito sends Hagen, accompanied by some of his
                    caporegimes, to Hollywood to persuade Jack Woltz (John Marley), a successful movie producer, to cast
                    Johnny in his new war film. Hagen offers his benefactor's help with Woltz's union problems and also
                    informs him that one of his actors has been using marijuana and heroin; a deleted scene in the movie
                    shows that this information would be used to damage Woltz's studio. Woltz rebuffs Hagen but becomes
                    more polite after learning he works for the Corleones. Woltz still refuses to cast Fontane, who
                    slept with one of Woltz's protégées, but offers to do any other favor for Vito, expressing his
                    intent to run Fontane out of the entertainment industry as retaliation for his affair. Hagen
                    declines, and soon afterward, Woltz awakens in bed with his prized racing stallion's severed head
                    planted under the satin covers, scaring him into casting Fontane in the film.

                </P>
                <P>Tom arranges a meeting between Vito and drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), who wants Vito to
                    help finance his narcotics business and provide legal protection and political influence. Vito
                    ultimately rejects the deal, however, on the grounds that it would cost him his influence over the
                    judges and police if they knew he was in the drug trade.

                </P>
                <P>Offended at the rejection of his deal, Sollozzo has Vito's personal assassin Luca Brasi (Lenny
                    Montana) murdered, Vito himself shot, and Hagen kidnapped off the street. Sollozzo tells Hagen that
                    Vito is dead, and tasks him with persuading Sonny to make peace and accept his narcotics deal. The
                    meeting is interrupted when Sollozzo receives word that Vito has survived the shooting, ruining
                    Sollozzo's original plan. Hagen tricks Sollozzo into believing that he will broker the narcotics
                    deal with the Corleones, and Sollozzo releases him, unharmed.

                </P>
                <P>Tom meets with Sonny, Michael, and Corleone caporegimes Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) and
                    Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda), and advises that if Vito dies, Sonny should agree to Sollozzo's deal,
                    and that the other Mafia families will most likely support Sollozzo to avoid a war. Two fish wrapped
                    in Luca Brasi's bulletproof vest arrive at the Corleone compound, an unmistakable message that Brasi
                    has been murdered by Sollozzo. Sonny orders Clemenza to execute Vito's traitorous bodyguard Paulie
                    Gatto (John Martino). Clemenza, accompanied by soldato (and later caporegime) Rocco Lampone (Tom
                    Rosqui), has Gatto drive out to a swampland, and exits the car to urinate as Lampone shoots and
                    kills Gatto.

                </P>
                <P>After Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on Vito by Sollozzo, he calls the Corleone
                    compound to warn Sonny. Tom goes to the hospital with private detectives that are licensed to carry
                    firearms to protect Vito and stops Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), a corrupt NYPD officer
                    on Sollozzo's payroll, from taking Michael into police custody. Sonny then orders Bruno Tattaglia,
                    son and underboss of Sollozzo's ally Philip Tattaglia (Victor Rendina), to be murdered. Sollozzo
                    requests a meeting and proposes that Michael be sent to broker a truce. Sonny, believing it is a
                    trick, refuses and demands that the other Mafia families hand over Sollozzo to the Corleone family
                    or else face war. Tom successfully convinces Sonny to wait because McCluskey has agreed to be
                    Sollozzo's bodyguard and warns Sonny that killing McCluskey would violate a long-standing Mafia rule
                    to not kill members of law enforcement. Violation of the rule would cause harmful backlash from
                    rival Mafia families and law enforcement. Michael suggests they agree to Sollozzo's meeting but
                    insist it be held in a public place, to lull Sollozzo into a feeling of safety. Michael devises a
                    plan: he will kill McCluskey and Sollozzo and then have journalists on the Corleone payroll run
                    stories about McCluskey's ties to drug trafficking operations, which will convince the other
                    families not to retaliate on the grounds of McCluskey's corruption. Sonny agrees and approves the
                    hit.

                </P>
                <P>Tom is nervous about putting Michael at risk but Sonny discovers the location of the meeting, an
                    Italian restaurant, from a policeman on the Corleone payroll in McCluskey's precinct. Clemenza
                    plants a revolver behind a toilet tank in the restaurant's bathroom, which Michael retrieves before
                    returning to his table and shooting both men dead. The killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey and the
                    subsequent Mafia war between the Corleone family and the Five Families sparks a massive crackdown by
                    law enforcement. Michael hides in Sicily and Vito returns home. Tom informs Vito that the police
                    have cracked down on all Mafia operations. Tom informs Vito that it was Michael who killed Sollozzo
                    and McCluskey and thus had to flee. As the impulsive Sonny takes command of the Corleone family
                    while his father recovers, Tom advises peace while Sonny is eager for revenge. Impatient with Tom's
                    rationality, Sonny lashes out and belittles Tom's abilities as a wartime consigliere, but
                    immediately apologizes.

                </P>
                <P>Tom again acts as intermediary when Michael's girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) arrives at the
                    Corleone compound wanting to contact Michael. Tom denies knowledge of Michael's whereabouts and
                    refuses her letter. Tom advises she be patient and that Michael will eventually contact her.

                </P>
                <P>When Sonny is murdered by men working for Vito's chief rival Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte), Tom
                    tearfully informs Vito of his son's death. Tom accompanies Vito to the funeral home of Amerigo
                    Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto), where Vito has Bonasera repair Sonny's body for his funeral. Vito
                    orders no retaliation for Sonny's murder and has Tom organize a meeting with the other Mafia bosses
                    to end the war. Vito makes peace with Philip Tattaglia and gives his word he won't break the peace.
                    After the meeting, Vito tells Tom that Barzini was behind Sonny's murder.

                </P>
                <P>Vito semi-retires in 1954 and Michael becomes operating head of the family. Michael removes Hagen as
                    consigliere in favor of having Vito fill the position, restricting Tom to handling the family's
                    legal business in Nevada, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Michael and Vito explain that the Corleones risk
                    inciting a fight with the planned move to Nevada, and they need a "wartime consigliere". Tom is
                    hurt, but accepts the decision and remains loyal. In truth, Michael and Vito have been secretly
                    planning to wipe out the other New York Dons and establish the Corleone family as the most powerful
                    crime family in the country. Vito explains he advised Michael on removing Tom as consigliere, and
                    although Vito considered Tom a good consigliere, and he, like Michael, has all of Vito's confidence,
                    there are reasons why Tom must not have any part of the plan. Tom accepts the decision. In the novel
                    (and in a deleted scene from the film), Tom notices that bodyguard Rocco Lampone has been secretly
                    promoted to caporegime and hitman Al Neri reports directly to Michael, rather than through Clemenza
                    and Tessio. Vito reminds Michael that he warned him these details wouldn't escape Tom's attention.

                </P>
                <P>After Vito's death, Tom accompanies Michael to the funeral, where Michael deduces that Tessio has
                    betrayed the family to Barzini. Tom is present when Tessio is taken away to be executed, and is also
                    present when Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), the abusive husband of Vito's daughter Connie (Talia
                    Shire), is garroted and murdered by Clemenza for his complicity in Sonny's murder. Although Tom is
                    used to violence and accepts that treachery is never forgiven, in the novel he feels sickened by
                    Tessio's imminent death and had even asked if Tessio could be spared.

                </P>
                <P>In the novel, Michael's wife, Kay learns that Michael ordered his brother-in-law Carlo's death, and
                    flees to her parents' home in New Hampshire. Michael sends Tom there to persuade Kay to return. Tom
                    ultimately risks his own life by "hypothetically" revealing some family secrets to Kay so she can
                    understand Michael's motives.</P>
